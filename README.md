# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
In this challenge I worked off of some starter code provided for me in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the HTML file I added some more blocks of time to be able to schedule out normal 9-5 workday. In the JavaScipt file I added a function to be able to track the date and time using the Day.js link in the HTML. I then created a function to call to that time and block out what hours were available in the current work day. Hours that have passed will be blocked out in gray and the current hour will be highlighted in red. Any future hours are represented as green boxes. There is also the capability to save scheduled text to the local storage for future reference.

I made this quiz with the following files
-index.html
-style.css
-script.js
